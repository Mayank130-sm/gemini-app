#SilentScan: AI-Powered, Privacy-Focused Health Risk Assessment
Project Description
SilentScan is an innovative, modular web application designed to provide users with preliminary, privacy-focused insights into potential health risks across various common conditions. Leveraging an intuitive user interface and intelligent (simulated) AI logic, SilentScan empowers individuals to understand potential health indicators and encourages timely professional medical consultation.

In a world where health data privacy is paramount, SilentScan aims to set a new standard by focusing on confidentiality and responsible AI integration for early health awareness.

Key Features & Innovations
Multi-Modular Health Assessment
SilentScan offers dedicated assessment modules for a range of conditions, demonstrating a versatile and expandable platform:

Breast Cancer Risk: Assesses personal and reproductive health factors for risk estimation.

Testicular Cancer Risk: Evaluates specific historical and genetic factors for male health risk.

PCOS Risk Assessment: Analyzes menstrual, hormonal, and metabolic indicators.

STI Symptom Classifier: Helps users understand potential conditions based on reported symptoms, with detailed follow-up questions.

Skin Disorder Detection: Allows image uploads for preliminary analysis of skin concerns, alongside detailed symptom descriptions.

User-Centric Design & Intuitive UX
We prioritized a seamless and engaging user experience:

Clean & Modern UI: A dark theme with vibrant neon accents provides a sleek and inviting interface.

Guided Workflow: A clear landing page welcomes users and a prominent disclaimer ensures responsible usage from the start.

Intelligent Forms: Detailed, yet easy-to-understand questions gather comprehensive data. Conditional fields dynamically appear for STI and Skin analysis, reducing clutter.

Real-time Validation & Feedback: Instant visual cues (e.g., error messages, input highlighting) help users correct input errors immediately.

Actionable Guidance: Beyond just risk percentages, the system provides safe and practical precautions for users to consider while they await professional medical advice.

Smooth Interactions: Animated transitions, loading spinners, and discreet notification pop-ups enhance responsiveness and user satisfaction.

Robust Technical Foundation
Built with modern web technologies, SilentScan features a clear and scalable architecture:

Frontend (HTML, Tailwind CSS, jQuery): A responsive and dynamic interface, with well-structured HTML and custom CSS for a polished look. JavaScript handles all client-side interactions, form validation, and dynamic content.

Backend (Node.js with Express): A powerful and lightweight server that handles API requests, processes user data, and manages image uploads.

Modular API Endpoints: Each health assessment module communicates with its own dedicated API endpoint, allowing for independent development and potential integration with specialized AI models.

Intelligent Mock AI Logic: For the hackathon, we've implemented sophisticated mock AI logic that simulates realistic risk assessments and relevant guidance based on weighted input factors, demonstrating the envisioned capabilities of a true AI system.

How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone <your-repo-link>
cd SilentScan
Install Backend Dependencies:
Navigate to the project root where server.js is located and install Node.js dependencies:

Bash

npm install express cors multer
Start the Backend Server:

Bash

node server.js
The server will start on http://localhost:3000. You should see a message in your terminal indicating it's running.

Open the Frontend:
Navigate to the frontend directory (if you've organized it that way, or just ensure index.html and script.js are in the same folder) and simply open index.html in your web browser.

Future Enhancements
Real AI Model Integration: Replace mock logic with actual machine learning models (e.g., trained on anonymized medical datasets) for more accurate predictions.

Advanced Privacy Technologies: Explore federated learning, differential privacy, or homomorphic encryption to ensure user data remains private even during AI training and inference.

User Accounts & History: Implement user authentication and the ability to save and track past assessment results.

Telemedicine Integration: Connect users with healthcare professionals based on their assessment results.

Mobile Application: Develop native iOS/Android applications for wider accessibility.
